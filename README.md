# Film Scout

Penny Lane Agency's current website is static and merely has a simple splash and contact page. Clients of Penny Lane currently email the agents property info and photos. 
The agents has a giant collection of property location on their desktop and need to manually sift through their computer files to find the filming locations.

UI/UX team Kat, Shen, and Daniel designed a website that would solve this problem.


Introducting Film Scout:

A web app that allows visitors to browse filming locations: houses, offices, businesses, parks, gardens, and other locations and book them through an agent.

Users are able to filter search results by tags: in the input tag box, users can select from a myriad of features the user needs: whether the location needs a pool, fireplace, spa, garden, chandelier, etc.

The agent, or admin is able to create an account and do CRUD operations on shooting locations. 

Normal website uses are unable to register for an account. The website is the middleman between the film shooting locations and the client.
